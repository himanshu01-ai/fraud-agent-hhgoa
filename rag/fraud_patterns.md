## The five known fraud patterns

These are the patterns the bank's analysts recognize. **They are not the only patterns in the data.** Noticing activity that fits none of them, describing it in your own words, and recommending a defensible action is scored.

**1. Card testing.** A stolen card number is checked before use: three or more tiny online authorizations, often under $5, then a larger purchase. Confirmed by the sequence itself. Policy R5.

**2. Card-not-present fraud.** The number is used online without the card. Amounts and products that don't fit the cardholder's history, often in a burst of two to four within 48 hours. On its own, one unusual online purchase is ambiguous: verify. Policy R1 to R4.

**3. Card-not-present fraud from a new device.** Same as above, with the identity record marking the device as `New` for this account, sometimes behind a proxy. Stronger than pattern 2, still not proof: people buy new phones.

**4. Out-of-region use.** Card-present purchases in a billing region the cardholder has no history in, while their normal activity continues at home. Several days of purchases in one new region is a trip, not a clone. Policy R2, R3.

**5. Account takeover.** Mixed-channel activity inconsistent with the cardholder, often with device and match-flag anomalies, pointing to stolen credentials rather than a stolen number.


## Things to know

- **A risk score is a reason to look.** Never a verdict.
- **Half the cases are legitimate.** Many look suspicious. An agent that blocks everything scores badly.
- **The known patterns are not the only ones.** Some activity in this data fits none of the five. Noticing it and describing it in your own words is scored.
- **Devices and regions connect people.** A device profile or a billing region shared across many cards in a short window is worth a look. Some cases can only be solved by asking what happened on *other* cards.
- **The V, C, D, M and numeric id columns are real model features with no names.** You may use them as signals. Say so in your evidence rather than pretending to know what V127 means.
- **Customer and analyst replies are not provided.** If your agent asks the customer or requests step-up authentication, simulate the response in your own system and record what you assumed in `evidence_requests`.
